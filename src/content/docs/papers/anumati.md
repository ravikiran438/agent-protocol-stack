## Abstract

As autonomous AI agents increasingly call other agents to complete tasks on
behalf of a human principal, a structural accountability gap has emerged:
the calling agent accepts the terms of service of the callee without any
protocol-level mechanism to prove that it understood those terms or that
it subsequently honoured them. Authentication protocols such as OAuth
and mutual TLS establish *who* may call *which* capability. They do not
address *under what conditions* a permitted call may be made, and those
conditions change as the callee's policies evolve. In this paper we
formalise the distinction between *proof of acceptance* (a timestamped
acknowledgement) and *proof of adherence* (a per-action reasoning record
citing the specific clause evaluated). We propose three primitives
(PolicyDocument, ConsentRecord, and AdherenceEvent) that together
constitute a versioned, append-only consent model for agent-to-agent
communication. The model is instantiated as a non-breaking extension to
two widely used agent protocols: the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol and the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). A TLA+ specification of the consent
lifecycle, together with a reference Python implementation of the chain
integrity and adherence trail validators, is available in the
accompanying repository.

## 1. Introduction

In this section we discuss the motivation leading to our work, an overview
of the current state of consent handling in agent protocols, and our
approach to closing the accountability gap that we identify. Section 1.1
gives background on how calling agents today commit their principals to
the terms of the services they call. Section 1.2 describes the motivation
upon which the work was developed, including the empirical evidence that
agents are not honouring even basic exclusion signals today, and the
regulatory pressure under the EU AI Act. Section 1.3 describes related
work in single-agent governance, runtime enforcement, and privacy
standards. Section 1.4 describes the specific contributions of this work
and our approach.

### 1.1 Background

The Agent2Agent protocol (A2A) [4] standardises how one agent advertises
its capabilities and authenticates another. The Model Context Protocol
(MCP) [5] plays an analogous role for communication between an
orchestrator agent and the tools or data sources it consumes. Both protocols delegate security to standard HTTP
authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.x, API keys, OpenID Connect, and
mutual TLS. These mechanisms are well designed for the question they
answer: given a request, is the requesting agent permitted to invoke the
requested capability.

A second category of rules governs something different. Consider an agent
that provides a data analysis service. Authentication tells the calling
agent whether it is permitted to invoke the `analyse_dataset` skill. It
says nothing about whether the calling agent may store the task output
beyond the current session, whether it may aggregate results across
multiple principals, whether it is obligated to notify its human principal
before invoking skills above a given cost threshold, or whether it may
share results with a third agent the callee has not authorised. These
constraints are contextual, compositional, and they change as the callee's
policies evolve. They cannot be encoded in OAuth scopes, which are
discrete, static, and binary. Scopes answer "permitted or not." Usage
policy answers "permitted, under these conditions, as of this version,
subject to change."

Further complicating the picture, under the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act (UETA) §14, contracts formed by electronic agents bind
the human principal, even without their awareness [7, 8]. As callee
policies evolve and calling agents continue operating under stale terms,
the principal's legal exposure compounds silently.

### 1.2 Motivation

The gap is not theoretical. The 2025 AI Agent Index surveyed 30 deployed
agents and found that only 6 of them explicitly stated that their crawler
bots respect robots.txt, while 16 provided no clear statement about web
exclusion compliance at all [1]. Robots.txt is a proxy: if agents ignore
the most basic signal of "do not access this," there is no reason to
expect that they will honour more nuanced usage terms. The problem is
empirical and is worsening as agent deployment scales.

The EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) compounds the urgency. The Act
enforces in phases. Prohibited AI practices took effect in February 2025
and general-purpose AI model obligations from August 2025. The obligations
most relevant to autonomous agent transactions, namely Art. 14 (human
oversight of high-risk AI systems) and Art. 50 (transparency obligations
including disclosure of AI-generated content and automated decision-making),
take effect on August 2, 2026 for high-risk systems listed in Annex I and
Annex III [2]. As of this writing, the EU AI Office has published no
technical guidance addressing consent mechanisms for autonomous
agent-to-agent transactions [3]. For systems in scope, effective oversight
requires, at minimum, that the principal can determine what policies the
agent agreed to, what clauses it evaluated at each action, and what
reasoning it applied. The present model is designed to provide exactly
that audit surface in advance of such guidance, so that implementations
are not built retroactively under deadline pressure.

Several years ago I implemented a versioned terms-of-service system at a
consumer technology company that tried to take this problem seriously.
Policy documents were managed in a headless content management system
(CMS) with full version history, each published version immutable and
content-addressed. The authentication state machine, built on a custom
OAuth 2-based flow, checked on every session whether the user's most
recently accepted document version matched the current published version.
If not, the session was blocked and the user was presented with the new
terms before proceeding. Every acceptance event was stored with a pointer
to the exact document version and a reference to the prior acceptance
record, forming a singly-linked chain per user. The goal was legal
defensibility: in any dispute, the system could show precisely which
version of the terms a user had accepted, and when, across the full
history of their account.

The data was unsurprising. Median time on the acceptance screen was under
four seconds. The linked chain proved acceptance with precision; it proved
nothing about comprehension or subsequent compliance. That experience
motivates the model we propose here. Autonomous agents, unlike humans,
are capable of parsing a policy clause by clause, evaluating each at
every action, and leaving a reasoning trail that a regulator or
principal can inspect after the fact. The consent infrastructure
available to them today does not ask them to do any of this.

### 1.3 Related Work

A family of recent proposals addresses agent governance from adjacent
directions. The Open Agent Governance Specification (OAGS) [12] defines
five governance primitives but is explicitly "local-first"; it governs
what a single agent may do in its own environment rather than what two
agents agree to when they interact. OpenMandate [15] takes a similar
single-agent stance using declarative YAML mandates. Policy Cards [16]
make an agent's constraints inspectable through machine-readable
artefacts, and the `PolicyDocument` we introduce is the callee-side
equivalent of a Policy Card.

At the runtime-enforcement layer, PCAS [17] compiles Datalog-derived
policies into instrumented agents that are compliant by construction.
MI9 [19] detects drift in agent behaviour after the fact. Both address a
different layer than the bilateral consent model we propose; a deployment
could use PCAS for local enforcement and the present model for cross-agent
consent in parallel.

Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) [18] proposes an external governance agent
supervising other agents at runtime. The AIGA Internet-Draft [14] proposes
tiered risk-based governance covering action authorisation and audit
logging. Both govern *what* an agent does; the model we propose governs
*under what agreed terms*.

For financial services, the FINOS AI Governance Framework v2.0 [13]
defines MI-21 (Agent Decision Audit and Explainability) with tiered audit
logging up to cryptographic tamper-evidence. MI-21 is conceptually close
to the adherence trail we describe in §3.3 but is explicitly silent on
consent versioning.

On the privacy and consent standards side, IEEE P7012 [20] defines
machine-readable personal privacy terms, and W3C DPV v2.2 [21] provides
standardised vocabularies for data processing activities. The Kantara
Consent Receipt [22] established early principles (consent as receipt,
machine-readability, user portability) that inform the `ConsentRecord`
design in §3.2.

### 1.4 Our Approach

We approach the problem by introducing three primitives that together
form a versioned, append-only consent model between any two agents.
`PolicyDocument` is the callee's machine-readable usage policy,
content-addressed and semver-versioned. `ConsentRecord` is the calling
agent's parsed understanding of that policy, with an entry for every
clause. `AdherenceEvent` is a per-action record that cites the specific
clause evaluated, the decision reached, and the natural-language reasoning
the agent applied. The three primitives together produce two linked
lists (a consent chain and an adherence trail) which together satisfy
five properties (completeness, traceability, tamper evidence, version
fidelity, and optional ledger anchoring) relevant to legal and regulatory
accountability.

We instantiate the model as a non-breaking extension to A2A [4] and MCP
[5] using each protocol's existing extension mechanism. We emphasise
that the instantiations require no changes to the A2A or MCP core
specifications; both protocols already provide native extension
mechanisms that our protocol, the Agent Consent and Adherence
Protocol (ACAP), uses without modification, and enforcement is
carried out by middleware at the caller and callee boundaries rather
than by the core runtime. We specify the consent lifecycle as a TLA+
state machine and verify seven safety properties and two liveness
properties under the TLC model checker. A reference Python
implementation of the canonical hashing, chain validator, and adherence
trail validator is provided in the accompanying repository, together
with 35 unit tests that exercise the structural invariants described in
§3.

Section 2 discusses why authentication alone is insufficient for usage
policy governance between agents. Section 3 introduces the three
primitives and the formal verification of the consent lifecycle. Section
4 shows how the model integrates into A2A and MCP without modification of
their core specifications. Section 5 surveys related work in more detail.
Section 6 discusses the known limitations of the model, including the
self-attestation boundary and agent ephemerality. Section 7 concludes.

The TLA+ specification, TLC configuration, protobuf schema, and reference
Python implementation are available at:

## 2. The Consent Gap in Agent Protocols

### 2.1 What Authentication Covers (and What It Does Not)

A2A supports OAuth 2.x, API keys, OpenID Connect, and mutual TLS [4]. MCP
uses OAuth 2.1 with incremental scope negotiation following its November
2025 specification update [6]. Both are well designed for their stated
purpose: establishing *who* may invoke *which* capability.

Usage policy governs something different. As described in §1.1, a callee
agent providing a data analysis service cannot express, through OAuth
scopes alone, whether the calling agent may store task output beyond the
current session, aggregate results across multiple principals, notify its
human principal before expensive skill invocations, or share results with
a third agent. These constraints are contextual, compositional, and
evolve as the callee's policies change. They cannot be encoded in OAuth
scopes, which are discrete, static, and binary.

### 2.2 The Version Problem

Human-facing terms of service change. Services update their policies,
publish new versions, and expect users to re-accept. In practice this is
handled by a login gate: the user sees a banner, clicks agree, and the
session proceeds. The mechanism is crude but functional.

For agents, no equivalent mechanism exists in current protocols. Neither
A2A nor MCP defines a versioned usage policy object, a typed consent
record, or a mechanism to block skill invocation until a new policy has
been processed [4, 5]. When a callee updates its terms, calling agents
have no protocol-level notification and no structured way to record
re-acceptance. Thus the liability accumulates silently, and the human
principal identified through UETA §14 ends up bound to terms the agent
has never in fact evaluated.

### 2.3 Proof of Acceptance vs. Proof of Adherence

We distinguish two consent properties.

**Proof of acceptance** is the traditional model: a timestamped record
binding an identity to a document version at a point in time. It proves
a party *agreed*. It proves nothing about whether the party *understood*
the terms or *subsequently complied* with them.

**Proof of adherence** is what agents can uniquely provide: a per-action
record citing the specific policy clause evaluated, the agent's
reasoning, and the enforcement decision. It proves the agent *evaluated*
the relevant clause *before acting*.

Table 1 summarises the distinction.

| Dimension | Proof of Acceptance | Proof of Adherence |
|---|---|---|
| Granularity | Whole document | Per-clause, per-action |
| Timing | At acceptance event | At every action attempt |
| Content | Timestamp + identity | Clause citation + reasoning |
| Understanding | Assumed | Verified (parsed claims) |
| Post-acceptance compliance | Unverifiable | Auditable |
| Legal value | Proves agreement | Proves agreement *and* compliance |

Agents are capable of proof of adherence because they can reason about
policy text. The consent infrastructure in current agent protocols simply
does not ask them to. Closing that gap is the work of this paper.

## 3. A Formal Consent Model

We define three primitives. Together they constitute a versioned,
append-only consent model for agent-to-agent communication. We refer to
the resulting protocol as the **Agent Consent and Adherence Protocol
(ACAP)**.

### 3.1 PolicyDocument

A `PolicyDocument` is the machine-readable equivalent of a terms-of-service
document. It is versioned using semantic versioning, content-addressed
via SHA-256, and published by the callee agent at a well-known HTTPS URL.

Formally, a `PolicyDocument` *P* is a tuple:

```
P = (version, hash, effective_date, supersedes, claims, publisher, natural_language_uri)
```

where `version` is a semver string, `hash` is the SHA-256 digest of the
canonical JSON serialisation of *P* with the `hash` field set to the
empty string (which breaks the circularity such that the digest input
never includes itself), `effective_date` is an ISO 8601 timestamp,
`supersedes` is the version of the document *P* replaces (if any),
`claims` is a sequence of `PolicyClaim` objects (order preserving; claim
order is significant for display and diff computation), `publisher` is
the callee agent's identifier (DID or HTTPS URL), and
`natural_language_uri` is the URL of the human-readable document from
which the claims are derived.

A `PolicyClaim` *c* is a tuple:

```
c = (id, clause_ref, action, asset, rule_type, constraint, since_version,
     category, dimension)
```

where `rule_type` is one of {permission, prohibition, obligation},
`action` and `asset` use ODRL 2.2 vocabulary where applicable [9], and
`constraint` is an optional ODRL constraint expression. The `since_version`
field records which policy version introduced this claim, enabling
calling agents to compute diffs between versions. The `category` and
`dimension` fields classify the claim by kind of data and kind of
operation; these are consumed by extensions (see §6.3) and may be left
unspecified in the core.

The key design constraint is that every `PolicyClaim` must have a stable
`id` across versions. A claim that changes meaning between versions MUST
be assigned a new `id`; the old `id` is retired. This allows calling
agents to detect precisely which claims changed when a version bumps.

### 3.2 ConsentRecord

A `ConsentRecord` documents the calling agent's parsed understanding of
and decision about a specific `PolicyDocument` version. Records form a
singly-linked list (the *consent chain*) for a given caller-callee pair.

Formally, a `ConsentRecord` *R* is a tuple:

```
R = (id, prev_id, caller, callee, policy_version, policy_hash,
     parsed_claims, decision, timestamp, valid_until, signature,
     caller_capability_hash, reconsent_trigger)
```

where `prev_id` references the immediately preceding record in the chain
(null for the first record), `parsed_claims` contains one `ParsedClaim`
entry for every `PolicyClaim` in the referenced `PolicyDocument`,
`decision` is one of {accepted, rejected, conditional}, and `valid_until`
is either an ISO 8601 timestamp or a sentinel value
(`"on_version_bump"`, `"on_capability_change"`, or `"on_any_change"`;
see §3.6).

A `ParsedClaim` entry records, for each policy claim, whether the calling
agent understood the claim, whether it disputes the claim, and if
disputed, a natural-language explanation of the dispute.

**Critical invariant**: every `PolicyClaim` in the `PolicyDocument` MUST
have a corresponding `ParsedClaim` in the `ConsentRecord`. Agents cannot
silently ignore inconvenient clauses. This single requirement is what
separates the model from a boolean acceptance flag.

Conditional consent is supported such that when `decision` is
`conditional`, the calling agent has accepted *some* claims but disputes
others. The callee MUST enforce claim-level gating: a skill whose
governing `PolicyClaim` is marked `disputed: true` in the `ParsedClaim`
array is blocked, while skills governed by undisputed claims remain
invocable. This allows the agent to continue operating at reduced
capability rather than halting entirely, which is a practical necessity
for long-running agent workflows where a blanket rejection would cascade
into downstream failures.

The callee enforces claim-level gating by cross-referencing the
`ParsedClaim` array in the caller's `ConsentRecord` against its own skill
registry. Each skill in the callee's A2A `AgentCard` (or MCP tool
manifest) is annotated with the `claim_id` values that govern it via the
`policy_claims` array (see §4.1). When the callee receives a task
request, it resolves the caller's active `ConsentRecord`, iterates the
requested skill's `policy_claims`, and checks whether any referenced
claim is marked `disputed: true` or `understood: false`. If so, the
callee MUST reject the invocation with a structured error indicating
which claims block the skill.

The linked-list structure of the consent chain is central to the legal
value of the model. A chain of records shows the full history of what a
calling agent agreed to on behalf of its principal, at the time of each
action, rather than just at signup. We used the same linked structure in
a prior production human-authentication system to preserve all accepted
versions of terms per user for legal auditability. Here it is applied to
the agent-to-agent context and extended to include the per-action
adherence records described in §3.3.

### 3.3 AdherenceEvent

An `AdherenceEvent` records the calling agent's runtime evaluation of a
policy claim for a specific action attempt. Events form a second
singly-linked list (the *adherence trail*) anchored to a `ConsentRecord`.

Formally, an `AdherenceEvent` *E* is a tuple:

```
E = (id, prev_id, consent_record_id, action, claim_id, clause_ref,
     decision, reasoning, timestamp, context, signature)
```

where `decision` is one of {permit, deny, escalate} and `reasoning` is a
natural-language string explaining why the agent reached that decision.

The `reasoning` field is the mechanism that makes adherence auditable.
An agent that records:

> *"Action 'aggregate\_sessions' maps to odrl:aggregate on pii:session\_data.
> Policy v2.1.0 §3.4 prohibits this where purpose = behavioural\_profiling.
> Denying."*

has produced something qualitatively different from a system that simply
refuses a request. The reasoning is citable, inspectable, and attributable.
Auditors can trace any enforcement decision back to the exact clause that
governed it.

### 3.4 Chain Properties

The two linked lists (the consent chain and the adherence trail)
together satisfy five properties that are relevant to legal and
regulatory accountability.

1. **Completeness.** Every action attempt produces an adherence event.
   A deny without an event is indistinguishable from a silent failure.

2. **Traceability.** Every adherence event references a consent record,
   which in turn references a policy document version. The full chain
   from action to clause is traversable.

3. **Tamper evidence.** Records and events carry optional JWS signatures
   [10] over their canonical JSON with the `signature` field set to the
   empty string prior to signing, using the same bootstrapping convention
   as `PolicyDocument.hash` in §3.1. The resulting signature is then
   inserted into the record. A verifier can confirm that no record was
   modified after signing.

4. **Version fidelity.** The `policy_hash` field in the consent record
   binds the acceptance to the exact document content, independent of
   URI availability. The hash survives link rot.

5. **Ledger anchoring (optional).** JWS signatures prove *who signed*
   but not *when*, and they cannot prevent collusion. If both parties
   agree to rewrite the chain, signatures alone cannot detect it. For
   deployments requiring third-party tamper evidence, each record may
   carry a `ChainAnchor`: a cryptographic hash anchored to an external
   append-only ledger. The model is ledger-agnostic; the anchor may
   point to a public blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon), a permissioned
   ledger (Hyperledger Fabric), or a transparency log (RFC 9162).
   Anchoring is strictly additive and deployments that do not require
   it simply omit the `chain_anchor` field.

### 3.5 Formal Verification of the Consent Lifecycle

We specify the consent lifecycle as a TLA+ state machine and verify its
safety and liveness properties under model checking. The specification
is included in the reference repository
(`specification/ConsentLifecycle.tla`) with the corresponding TLC
configuration (`specification/ConsentLifecycle.cfg`).

The lifecycle has seven states for a given caller–callee pair: Idle,
PolicyFetched, GovernanceReview, Accepted, Rejected, Conditional, and
Stale, shown in Figure 1. Table 2 lists the safety and liveness
properties verified by TLC.

![ACAP consent lifecycle state machine. The seven states govern the bind/re-bind cycle between a single caller and callee pair. GovernanceReview is reachable only when the governance-tiering extension is loaded (see §6.3); with the core alone, re-consents flow directly from PolicyFetched to the decision states.](/agent-protocol-stack/figures/anumati/state-machine.png)

**Table 2.** Safety and liveness properties verified by TLC.

| ID | Property | Kind | Statement |
|----|----------|------|-----------|
| S1 | NoSkillWithoutConsent | Safety | A skill call never occurs unless at least one ConsentRecord in the chain has decision ∈ {accepted, conditional}. |
| S2 | ChainMonotonicity | Safety | `consentChain` and `adherenceTrail` are append-only; lengths never decrease. |
| S3 | AdherenceAnchored | Safety | Every AdherenceEvent references a valid ConsentRecord index. |
| S4 | SkillRequiresPermit | Safety | A skill call is always preceded by at least one AdherenceEvent with decision = permit on an undisputed claim. |
| S5 | ConditionalGating | Safety | A disputed claim always produces deny or escalate, never permit. |
| S6 | NoDisputedPermit | Safety | No adherence event for a disputed claim carries a permit decision. |
| S7 | NoSkillOnCapabilityDrift | Safety | No skill call occurs when the caller's capability fingerprint has changed since the ConsentRecord was created. |
| L1 | EventualReConsent | Liveness | Under weak fairness, any staleness (version bump or capability change) eventually leads to a new ConsentRecord. |
| L2 | EventualCapReConsent | Liveness | A capability bump eventually leads to re-consent. The agent does not operate indefinitely under stale reasoning. |

Properties S1–S4 establish the core consent-before-action guarantee.
S5–S6 formalise conditional gating for reduced-permission operation. S7
addresses agent ephemerality such that capability drift blocks all skill
invocation until re-consent is obtained. We note that
`caller_capability_hash` is self-reported by the caller and the callee
cannot independently verify it; this is a known limitation which we
discuss in §6.1. L1 and L2 ensure the protocol does not deadlock after
either a policy version bump or a capability change.

The model was checked with TLC using `MaxVersions = 3`,
`MaxAdherenceEvents = 4`, and `MaxCapVersions = 2`, covering three policy
version bumps, two capability changes, and four adherence events per
consent epoch. All nine properties hold with zero violations across the
reachable state space. TLC performs bounded model checking such that it
exhausts the state space within the declared constant bounds but does
not constitute a proof for arbitrary parameter values. The bounds were
chosen to cover realistic deployment scenarios; unbounded verification
would require inductive proof techniques beyond the scope of the present
work.

### 3.6 Capability-Bound Consent

Human users persist. They create accounts, accumulate consent history,
and the consent chain tracks a stable identity across years. Agents are
different in kind such that they are spawned, updated, and terminated.
An agent instance may exist for minutes or hours, and the next instance,
even if it shares the same `caller_agent_id`, may run a different model,
carry different tools, or operate under a different context window.

This creates a problem that human consent systems never face: the
reasoning entity that consented may not be the reasoning entity that
acts. An agent running GPT-4o that recorded `understood: true` for a
prohibition on data aggregation may be replaced by an instance running a
fine-tuned variant that interprets "aggregation" differently. The
`ParsedClaim` entries in the original `ConsentRecord` are no longer
trustworthy, not because they were falsified, but because the entity
that produced them no longer exists.

The model addresses this with `caller_capability_hash`, a SHA-256
fingerprint of the agent's model identifier, tool manifest, and reasoning
configuration (system prompt, temperature, and any chain-of-thought or
retrieval-augmented generation settings that influence how the agent
interprets policy claims), recorded on every `ConsentRecord`. The hash
is computed over the canonical JSON serialisation (RFC 8785) of a
`CapabilityManifest` object containing these fields in alphabetical key
order, using the same circularity-breaking convention as
`PolicyDocument.hash` in §3.1, such that the `caller_capability_hash`
field is set to the empty string before hashing. Three re-consent
triggers are defined:

| Trigger | Cause | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `POLICY_BUMP` | Callee publishes new PolicyDocument | Re-fetch, diff, re-consent |
| `CAPABILITY_CHANGE` | Caller's capability hash changes | Re-evaluate all ParsedClaims |
| `PRINCIPAL_CHANGE` | Human principal identity changes | Full re-consent with new principal_id |

The `valid_until` field supports sentinel values that control
invalidation granularity: `"on_version_bump"` for callee-side changes
only, `"on_capability_change"` for caller-side changes only, or
`"on_any_change"` for either side. This lets callees choose their risk
tolerance such that a financial-services agent may require
`"on_any_change"` while a low-stakes utility agent may accept
`"on_version_bump"`.

The consent chain is stored by the callee. It is the callee's audit
trail and the callee's legal protection. The chain is keyed by
`caller_agent_id`, which is a DID or HTTPS URL bound to the principal
or organisation rather than to the process, so new agent instances
inherit the chain if they share the identity. Both parties SHOULD
maintain independent copies of the chain. The callee's copy is
authoritative; the caller's copy provides independent evidence if the
callee's ledger is unavailable, tampered with, or disputed. The chain
itself is append-only; agent termination does not delete records.

## 4. Protocol Instantiations

An important design constraint of the present work is that the
instantiations described in this section do not require changes to the
A2A or MCP core specifications. Both protocols already define a native
extension mechanism (`capabilities.extensions` in A2A and the
`capabilities` object in MCP), and ACAP is implemented entirely through
those mechanisms and through middleware at the caller and callee
boundaries. The reference implementation described in §4.3 confirms
that a working end-to-end deployment is buildable today with existing
A2A and MCP libraries, which means adoption is a matter of installing
a middleware library at each participating agent rather than advancing
a specification revision.

### 4.1 Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol

A2A is an open, vendor-neutral protocol for agent-to-agent communication
[4]. Each agent's AgentCard is a JSON document published at
`/.well-known/agent-card.json` that advertises the agent's capabilities,
skills, and authentication requirements.

A2A supports protocol extensions via the `capabilities.extensions` array
[4]. Each extension is declared with a `uri`, a `description`, and a
`required` flag. This is the mechanism used by the Agent Payments
Protocol (AP2) to advertise payment capability [11], and we use the same
mechanism for ACAP.

**Step 1: Declare the extension in the AgentCard**

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "extensions": [{
      "uri": "https://github.com/ravikiran438/agent-consent-protocol/v0.1",
      "description": "ACAP v0.1: versioned usage policy and consent auditing.",
      "required": true,
      "params": { "minVersion": "0.1", "maxVersion": "0.1" }
    }]
  },
  "usage_policy": {
    "version": "2.1.0",
    "document_uri": "https://callee.example.com/.well-known/usage-policy.json",
    "document_hash": "sha256:a3f5c2...",
    "effective_date": "2026-02-27T00:00:00Z",
    "acceptance_required": true,
    "acceptance_endpoint": "https://callee.example.com/acap/consent",
    "natural_language_uri": "https://callee.example.com/terms"
  }
}
```

The extension URI is versioned. When a future ACAP version introduces
breaking changes (for example, structured reasoning in a later version),
the URI changes accordingly. A calling agent that encounters an
unrecognised ACAP version SHOULD fall back to the highest mutually
supported version or decline the handshake.

**Step 2: Annotate skills with governing claims**

Each skill in the AgentCard carries a `policy_claims` array listing the
claim IDs that govern its use, mirroring the MCP `policyClaims`
annotation in §4.2. This allows the calling agent to evaluate only the
relevant claims before invoking each skill:

```json
{
  "skills": [{
    "name": "analyse_dataset",
    "policy_claims": ["claim-data-retention", "claim-aggregation-prohibition"]
  }]
}
```

Without this mapping, the callee has no mechanism to enforce claim-level
gating for conditional consent (§3.2), as it would not know which skills
to block when specific claims are disputed.

**Step 3: Consent handshake before first skill call**

The calling agent fetches the `PolicyDocument`, verifies its hash,
parses every `PolicyClaim`, and POSTs a `ConsentRecord` to the
`acceptance_endpoint` before invoking any skill. The callee verifies
that the record covers every claim and that the `policy_hash` matches
the current document. Only then does it permit skill invocation.

**Step 4: Per-action adherence recording**

Before each skill call, the calling agent evaluates the relevant claims
and POSTs an `AdherenceEvent` to the callee. The callee appends the
event to the adherence trail for that consent record. The complete flow
is shown in Figure 2.

![ACAP consent and adherence sequence.](/agent-protocol-stack/figures/anumati/sequence.png)

The `POST /acap/adherence` endpoint operates in one of two modes,
declared in the AgentCard's `usage_policy` object. In `local` mode the
adherence event is fire-and-forget such that the caller records its own
decision and the callee appends it to the audit trail. In `delegated`
mode the callee evaluates the event and returns an enforcement decision;
the caller MUST NOT invoke the skill until it receives a `permit`
response. Delegated mode adds a round trip but gives the callee veto
authority, which is appropriate for regulated interactions where the
callee bears compliance obligations.

When the callee publishes a new `PolicyDocument`, the calling agent
detects the version change on the next AgentCard fetch by comparing
`usage_policy.version` against the cached consent record's
`policy_version`. It then fetches the new document, identifies changed
claims via `since_version`, and creates a new `ConsentRecord` with
`prev_id` pointing to the now-invalidated record. The old record is
never deleted. The current detection mechanism is poll-based (AgentCard
fetch). For long-running workflows where polling latency is
unacceptable, callees SHOULD additionally support a push channel
(webhook callback or SSE endpoint) registered during the consent
handshake.

### 4.2 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP governs communication between an orchestrator agent (client) and
tools or data sources (servers) [5]. The MCP specification as of November
2025 [6] does not define a consent primitive analogous to what we propose,
and the instantiation below extends MCP using its standard `capabilities`
object.

The model maps to MCP as follows. The MCP `initialize` handshake response
includes a `capabilities` object. We add a `usagePolicy` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {},
    "usagePolicy": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "documentUri": "https://server.example.com/.well-known/usage-policy.json",
      "documentHash": "sha256:b7f3a1...",
      "acceptanceRequired": true
    }
  }
}
```

Individual tool definitions can carry a `policyClaims` annotation listing
the claim IDs that govern their use:

```json
{
  "name": "aggregate_user_data",
  "description": "Aggregates user data across sessions.",
  "policyClaims": ["claim-pii-aggregate-prohibition"],
  "inputSchema": { ... }
}
```

This allows calling agents to evaluate only the relevant subset of
claims before invoking each tool rather than re-evaluating the entire
policy document per call. The consent and adherence records use the same
schema as the A2A instantiation.

The MCP instantiation is lighter because MCP's trust boundary is
typically within a single organisation (orchestrator to owned tools).
Cross-organisational A2A calls carry higher legal weight and warrant the
fuller handshake described in §4.1.

### 4.3 Reference Implementation and Overhead

The accompanying repository provides a Python reference implementation
of the three structural operations that any ACAP implementation must
perform on every interaction: canonical hashing of the `PolicyDocument`
per §3.1, structural validation of the consent chain per §3.2, and
structural validation of the adherence trail per §3.3–§3.4. The
implementation is accompanied by 35 unit tests that exercise the
invariants described in those sections.

To characterise the per-call cost of the protocol on commodity
hardware, we ran a micro-benchmark of each operation on a 2024 MacBook
Air (Apple M4, Python 3.13.5). Each measurement is the median of 200 to 500
samples; the 99th percentile is reported alongside. The policy used for
the chain-validation rows contains ten claims, which is a typical size
for a production usage policy.

| Operation | Median | p99 |
|---|---:|---:|
| `compute_policy_hash` (10 claims) | 19 μs | 28 μs |
| `compute_policy_hash` (50 claims) | 74 μs | 88 μs |
| `compute_policy_hash` (200 claims) | 278 μs | 324 μs |
| `validate_consent_chain` (chain length 1) | 20 μs | 27 μs |
| `validate_consent_chain` (chain length 5) | 96 μs | 124 μs |
| `validate_consent_chain` (chain length 20) | 373 μs | 458 μs |
| `validate_adherence_trail` (trail length 10) | 3 μs | 9 μs |
| `validate_adherence_trail` (trail length 100) | 27 μs | 32 μs |
| `validate_adherence_trail` (trail length 1000) | 265 μs | 331 μs |

These numbers are in microseconds. A typical remote skill invocation
between two agents over the public internet sits in the 20–100 ms
range such that the ACAP overhead measured here represents well under
one percent of the skill-call latency it accompanies, even at chain
and trail lengths that are conservative overestimates of steady-state
operation.

Two caveats apply. First, the benchmark measures only the in-process
structural operations and does not include the network round-trip for
`POST /acap/consent` or `POST /acap/adherence`; the actual wall-clock
cost of the consent handshake on the wire will be dominated by TCP
and TLS setup rather than by the validators themselves. Second, JWS
signature verification is not yet implemented in the reference
validators and is therefore excluded from the numbers above. We
expect signature verification to add a further tens of microseconds
per record on the same hardware; this is a natural next step for the
reference implementation.

### 4.4 Demo Deployment

To confirm that the middleware framing in §4 actually composes with
existing A2A infrastructure, we built a two-agent end-to-end
deployment. The callee is a data-analysis agent implemented as a
FastAPI service that publishes an A2A AgentCard at
`/.well-known/agent-card.json` and mounts the ACAP callee middleware
described in `acap.middleware.callee` at the `/acap` URL prefix. The
caller is a marketing-insights agent implemented as an async Python
client wrapped in the `ACAPCaller` described in `acap.middleware.caller`.
Both agents use Gemini 2.5 Flash as their reasoning backend such that
the callee's skill delegates its one-shot dataset analysis to Gemini
and the caller uses Gemini to parse each `PolicyClaim` into a
`ParsedClaim` during the handshake.

The demonstration scenario is a policy with three prohibitions: a
retention limit on session data, a prohibition against aggregation
for behavioural profiling, and a prohibition against third-party
distribution. The caller declares its intent as producing a marketing
insights report that does not engage in behavioural profiling of
individual customers. Gemini parses each of the three claims as
understood and undisputed under that intent such that the caller
arrives at a `ConsentRecord` with `decision = accepted`. The caller
then attempts two skill calls in sequence: the first with
`purpose = behavioural_profiling`, which matches the prohibition's
constraint and is denied at the adherence layer before the skill is
ever invoked, and the second with `purpose = statistical_analysis`,
which the prohibition permits and which returns a qualitative summary.

![Caller agent trace: consent handshake (top), blocked skill call on a disputed purpose (middle), and permitted skill call returning a qualitative summary (bottom). Each parsed claim is produced by a Gemini call, and each adherence decision records a natural-language reasoning string as described in §3.3.](/agent-protocol-stack/figures/anumati/demo-caller-trace.png)

Figure 3 shows the caller's trace across the consent handshake and
both skill calls. The handshake block displays the three parsed claims
as evaluated by Gemini; the deny block shows the reasoning string
recorded by the `AdherenceEvent`; and the permit block shows the
callee's skill response alongside the `event_id` that authorised it.

![Callee server log for the same end-to-end session. Every interaction is a standard HTTP request against a FastAPI app, with the ACAP endpoints (`/acap/consent`, `/acap/adherence`, `/acap/audit`) sitting alongside the A2A-standard well-known paths. No modification of the A2A runtime is required.](/agent-protocol-stack/figures/anumati/demo-server-log.png)

Figure 4 shows the callee's HTTP log over the same session, which is
the cleanest evidence that ACAP requires no protocol-level
modification: every interaction is a standard HTTP request, and the
ACAP-specific endpoints sit alongside the A2A-standard
`/.well-known/agent-card.json` and `/.well-known/usage-policy.json`
paths under one FastAPI app.

![Audit endpoint output. The linked-list structure of the consent chain and adherence trail is visible through the `prev_record_id` and `prev_event_id` fields, and the per-action reasoning is preserved verbatim for later inspection.](/agent-protocol-stack/figures/anumati/demo-audit-json.png)

Figure 5 shows the audit endpoint's response. The linked-list
structure of the consent chain and the adherence trail is visible
through the `prev_record_id` and `prev_event_id` fields, and the
per-action reasoning is preserved verbatim for inspection by a human
principal, a compliance officer, or a regulator.

The full deployment code is in the `demo/` directory of the
accompanying repository. A reviewer can reproduce Figures 3 through 5
by following the README there; the end-to-end run completes in under
ten seconds on the same MacBook Air M4 that produced the benchmark
numbers in §4.3. The wall-clock time is dominated by the Gemini
inference calls (three during the handshake, one for the permitted
skill invocation) rather than by the ACAP validators themselves,
which contribute the microsecond-scale overhead reported in §4.3.

The Gemini-backed claim parser used in the demo is illustrative, not
normative. Because the parser is a non-deterministic language model,
two runs of the handshake against the same `PolicyDocument` can in
principle produce two different `ParsedClaim` arrays such that the
resulting `ConsentRecord` values are not byte-identical and therefore
not reproducible across runs. A production deployment should instead
use a deterministic parser, for example a rule-based ODRL evaluator,
a cached LLM output keyed on `(claim_id, caller_intent)` hash, or a
constrained-decoding pipeline with a fixed random seed. The caller
middleware is designed to accept any implementation of the
`ClaimParser` protocol such that an operator can substitute a
deterministic parser without changes to any other component. The
Gemini-backed parser remains useful during agent development for
exploration and for qualitative evaluation of a candidate policy.

## 5. Related Work

A fuller treatment of related work complements the summary in §1.3. We
survey proposals by the layer each addresses.

**Single-agent governance.** OAGS [12] defines five governance primitives
(deterministic identity, declarative policy, runtime enforcement,
structured audit evidence, cryptographic verification) but is explicitly
"local-first." It governs what one agent may do in its own environment,
not what two agents agree to when they interact. OpenMandate [15] takes
a similar single-agent stance, separating policy from execution using
declarative YAML mandates. Both address the right abstraction level but
stop at the organisational boundary. Policy Cards [16] make an
individual agent's constraints inspectable through machine-readable
governance artefacts. The `PolicyDocument` is the callee's equivalent of
a Policy Card, but `ConsentRecord` and `AdherenceEvent` capture the
bilateral negotiation and ongoing compliance that Policy Cards do not
cover.

**Runtime enforcement.** PCAS [17] compiles Datalog-derived policies
into instrumented agents that are policy-compliant by construction. A
deployment could use PCAS for local enforcement and ACAP for cross-agent
consent; the two address different layers. MI9 [19] focuses on drift
detection, identifying when agents deviate from expected behaviour. MI9
detects non-compliance after the fact; ACAP provides the evidentiary
basis (what was agreed, what was checked) that drift detection consumes.

**Governance architecture.** GaaS [18] proposes an external governance
agent supervising other agents at runtime. The AIGA Internet-Draft [14]
proposes tiered risk-based governance covering action authorisation and
audit logging. AIGA governs *what* an agent does; ACAP governs *under
what agreed terms*.

**Financial services.** FINOS AI Governance Framework v2.0 [13] defines
MI-21 (Agent Decision Audit and Explainability) with tiered audit
logging up to cryptographic tamper-evidence. MI-21 is conceptually close
to the adherence trail but is explicitly silent on consent versioning
[13]. A FINOS contribution to address the versioning gap is in
preparation.

**Privacy and consent standards.** IEEE P7012 [20] defines
machine-readable personal privacy terms. P7012 addresses the
human-to-service relationship; ACAP addresses the agent-to-agent
relationship where human preferences must propagate through delegation
chains. W3C DPV v2.2 [21] provides standardised vocabularies for data
processing activities. The Kantara Consent Receipt [22] established
early principles (consent as receipt, machine-readability, user
portability) that inform the `ConsentRecord` design.

**OAuth ecosystem.** UMA 2.0 [26] enables resource owners to control
delegated access through an authorisation server. UMA governs *who may
access which resource*; ACAP governs *what a calling agent agreed the
callee may do* and whether it honoured those terms at every action. RFC
9396 (Rich Authorization Requests) [25] extends OAuth with structured
authorization data beyond binary scopes. RAR lets a client express
*what* it wants to do, but is a request-time mechanism with no
versioning, no per-action adherence, and no re-consent on policy change.

**Audit trails.** AuditableLLM [23] contributes hash-chain audit trails
for language model interactions. Our chain structure shares the pattern
but applies it to consent and policy adherence across agent boundaries.

**Foundational analysis.** Rida [24] examines what consent means when an
AI agent, not a human, is the party clicking "I agree." That analysis
directly motivates the present work.

**ODRL 2.2** [9] provides the vocabulary we use for `PolicyClaim.action`
and `PolicyClaim.asset`. We treat ODRL as a vocabulary convention, not
a normative dependency. ODRL is a rights *expression* language, not a
consent *lifecycle* protocol. It has no `ConsentRecord`, no
`AdherenceEvent`, no versioned chain, and no capability-bound
invalidation. ACAP uses ODRL vocabulary for claim semantics and
addresses the consent lifecycle layer that ODRL does not cover.

Three contributions distinguish this work from the above: the
proof-of-adherence framing that shifts from one-time acceptance to
per-action, per-clause adherence events with reasoning trails; the
inter-agent consent chain as a versioned linked-list audit structure
*between* two agents; and capability-bound consent that ties consent
validity to the agent's own configuration.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Threat Model and Limitations

The `reasoning` field on `AdherenceEvent` is free-form natural language.
This is a deliberate choice for v0.1 such that the field is immediately
useful to human auditors. It also means reasoning strings are not
machine-comparable; two agents may evaluate the same clause differently
and produce non-equivalent reasoning strings with no way to detect the
discrepancy. A structured reasoning format would enable automated
auditing but would raise the implementation barrier substantially, and
we defer this.

The model assumes calling agents act in good faith when populating
`parsed_claims` and `reasoning`. A malicious agent could record
`understood: true` for a prohibition and then violate it. This is worse
than the current state in that it produces false evidence, but it also
creates a clearer liability standard. An agent that explicitly
acknowledged a prohibition and violated it has acted in demonstrable bad
faith, which is legally more tractable than silent non-compliance under
a clicked-through ToS. Similarly, property S7 guarantees that a
capability change triggers re-consent, but the `caller_capability_hash`
is self-reported and the callee has no mechanism to independently verify
the caller's capability fingerprint. The honest comparison is not "ACAP
vs. perfect enforcement" but "ACAP vs. the current state," which is no
consent record at all.

A fuller adversarial threat model (adversarial `caller_intent`
declaration that steers an LLM-backed claim parser toward a favourable
parse, `ConsentRecord` replay across agent identities, and
policy-squatting through an initial permissive version followed by a
restrictive version bump) is out of scope for the present work. We
note that analogous gaps exist in the human-consent layer that ACAP
is replacing, since a human signing a contract can also misstate
intent and a service can also substitute terms between acceptance and
use. The initial deployment context we anticipate is closed
enterprise integration in which both the caller's principal and the
callee operate under the same organisational trust boundary; the
adversarial extensions belong to a subsequent paper alongside
remote-attestation integration and signed replay defenses.

### 6.2 Open Questions

Three questions the community should resolve:

1. **Self-attestation vs. verification.** `ParsedClaim.understood` is
   currently self-attested. A verifiable proof that the calling agent
   processed the claim text would close the S7 gap; zero-knowledge
   proofs of document processing are theoretically possible but
   practically expensive.

2. **Grace periods.** `valid_until: "on_version_bump"` blocks all skill
   invocation immediately on version change. For long-running tasks, an
   immediate block may be disruptive, and a grace period (for example,
   complete in-flight tasks, block new initiations) needs specifying.

3. **Capability fingerprint granularity.** The `caller_capability_hash`
   is defined as a SHA-256 digest of model identifier, tool manifest, and
   reasoning configuration. In practice, what constitutes a "material"
   capability change is ambiguous. A minor prompt template update may
   not affect policy reasoning, while a model version bump almost
   certainly does. The current design treats any fingerprint change as
   a re-consent trigger; a future version may introduce a capability
   diff to distinguish material from immaterial changes.

### 6.3 Extensions Under Development

Several extensions to the core model are maintained in the accompanying
repository as separate proposals. These include tiered escalation via a
governance agent, asymmetric sensitivity preferences across data
category and usage dimension, structured regulatory context propagation
(for frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, and the EU AI Act), and a
plain-English audit projection layer. Each extension is maintained
independently with its own `README.md` and `STATUS.md` and is not part
of the core normative specification presented here.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The consent model we inherited from human authentication systems is a
timestamped acceptance record, and it is inadequate for autonomous agent
protocols. It proves acceptance. It cannot prove adherence. Agents are
capable of something humans are not, namely the ability to parse policy
documents, evaluate clauses at runtime, and produce reasoning trails for
every action. The three primitives proposed here (`PolicyDocument`,
`ConsentRecord`, and `AdherenceEvent`) provide the infrastructure to
make that capability useful. The versioned linked-list audit chain gives
legal accountability to the calling agent's principal. The A2A and MCP
instantiations in §4 demonstrate that ACAP deploys against today's
agent protocol infrastructure without requiring any changes to the A2A
or MCP core specifications. Adoption is a matter of installing a
middleware library at each participating agent, not of advancing a
specification revision.

The timing matters. The EU AI Act's high-risk enforcement date of August
2, 2026 is months away. The A2A specification is under active revision by
a Linux Foundation working group, and the FINOS AI Governance Framework
has an open gap in MI-21 on consent versioning. This is an unusually
short window in which a protocol proposal can land in multiple active
governance processes simultaneously.

I built a version of this system for humans, years ago at a consumer
technology company. Linked consent chains, immutable versions, the whole
audit trail. Users spent four seconds on the acceptance screen and the
chain proved acceptance with precision but proved nothing else. Agents
do not need four seconds. They need a protocol that asks them to
actually read the document, evaluate each clause, and leave a record of
what they decided and why. That is what ACAP provides.
